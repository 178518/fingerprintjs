Written in pure JavaScript, no dependencies. \r\nBy default uses [Murmur hashing][murmur] and returns a 32bit integer number.\r\nHashing function can be easily replaced.\r\nFeather weight: only **843** bytes when gzipped.\r\n\r\n## What is fingerprinting?\r\n\r\nFingerprinting is a technique, outlined in [the research by Electronic Frontier Foundation][research], of\r\nanonymously identifying a web browser with accuracy of up to 94%. \r\n\r\n\r\nBrowser is queries its agent string, screen resolution and color depth, \r\ninstalled plugins with supported mime types, timezone offset and other capabilities, \r\nsuch as local storage and session storage. Then these values are passed through a hashing function\r\nto produce a fingerprint that gives weak guarantees of uniqueness.\r\n\r\nNo cookies are stored to identify a browser.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that a mobile share of browsers is much more uniform, so fingerprinting should be used\r\nonly as a supplementary identifying mechanism.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar fingerprint = new Fingerprint().get();\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing custom hashing function\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nvar hasher = new function(value, seed){ return value.length % seed; }\r\nvar fingerprint = new Fingerprint(hasher).get();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Licence\r\n\r\nThis code is [MIT][mit] licenced:\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Valentin Vasilyev\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
